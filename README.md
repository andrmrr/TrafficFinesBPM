# Business Process Modeling of the traffic fine system in Italy
The goal of this project was to analyze and improve a given business process. The business process at hand is the **traffic fine management system** in Italy.
This project was an assignment for the Process-Oriented Data Science course and was done in a team of five and was done using **Disco**, **SAP Signavio** and **Python** scripting. The project has the following structure:
1. Data understanding - visualization and interpretation of individual variables
2. Process understanding - included defining complete cases, discovering rules of conformance and performing variant analysis
3. Data cleaning - missing values handling and data transformations
4. Finding relevant insights - bottlenecks, long vs. short cases, comparative analysis
5. Conclusion and recommendations for improving the process - raising fine amounts (especially for certain incidents), automatic certain transitions and introducing electronic notifications.
